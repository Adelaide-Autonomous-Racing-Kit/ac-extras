Helper functions and classes for use in AARK with the Assetto Corsa Interface

## Usage
To instantiate a `VehicleData` for a specific car in Assetto Corsa you will need to extract the car's data files.
You can either do this yourself by following [this guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxLLWfL0bfA) or use the pre-extracted files provided by us [here](https://adelaideautonomous.racing/downloads/#VehicleData)
